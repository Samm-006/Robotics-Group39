## Assistive Robot for Safe Navigation and Object Detection for Visually Impaired Individuals with Audio Feedback

### Overview

This project implements an assistive robot designed to help visually impaired individuals, capable of detecting objects with audio feedback to warn the user and guide them safely through a room. The system implemented combines different algorithms, SLAM for mapping and localisation, A* for optimal path, YOLO for object detection, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) for audio feedback, all into one integrated system.

### Objective 



### Pre-programmed packages:
- pyttsx3 
- opencv-python
- numpy
- pillow
- ultralytics
- matplotlib
- math
- copy
